# Shipment Q&A Chatbot (Hardened Edition)

A high-performance, security-first Shipment Q&A system built with **LangGraph**, **FastAPI**, and **Azure AI Search**. This version features advanced "Bring Your Own Data" (BYOD) analytics and AST-based security hardening.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The system utilizes a multi-agent orchestration pattern via **LangGraph** to handle complex logistics queries:

- **Intent Detection**: Advanced classification with praise-guardrails to maintain session continuity.
- **Hybrid Retrieval**: BM25 and Vector search integration via Azure AI Search with enforced Row-Level Security (RLS).
- **Hardened Analytics (BYOD)**: Dynamic analysis of Parquet/CSV datasets using a constrained AST-parsed Pandas engine.
- **Response Synthesis**: Context-aware answering with integrated data visualization (Bar/Line charts).

## 🔒 Security Posture

- **AST-Based RCE Mitigation**: Analytics queries are parsed into Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) to whitelist safe operations and block dangerous functions (`__import__`, `exec`, `eval`), providing a robust sandbox for dynamic code execution.
- **Identity Awareness**: Flexible identity scope resolution designed for VPN/Firewall deployments, balancing infrastructure-level trust with application-level authorization.
- **Secure API**: Hardened FastAPI implementation with CSP, HSTS, and Frame projection headers.
- **Persistent Sessions**: Reliable session management using environment-backed encryption keys.
